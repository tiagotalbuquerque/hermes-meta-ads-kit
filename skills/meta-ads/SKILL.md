# Meta Ads — Your AI Ad Manager

Stop clicking through Ads Manager. This skill wraps [social-cli](https://github.com/vishalgojha/social-CLI) to give you the five things that actually matter about your Meta campaigns — in plain text, every day.

The thesis: 90% of ad management is pattern recognition. Spend trending up or down. CTR declining (creative fatigue). CPA spiking (audience exhaustion). Winners emerging. Losers bleeding.

This skill spots the patterns. You make the calls.

Read `workspace/brand/` for project-local brand context if available.

Use Hermes output style: lead with key metrics, cite the script/data source, and separate recommendations from actions requiring approval.

## Hermes Execution Notes

When this skill is loaded by Hermes, do **not** assume the current working directory is the skill directory. Prefer this order:

1. If working inside a checkout of `hermes-meta-ads-kit`, run the repo wrapper: `./run.sh <command>`.
2. If the skill is installed into Hermes, run scripts by absolute path from the loaded skill directory, for example `$HERMES_HOME/skills/marketing/meta-ads/scripts/meta-ads.sh daily-check`.
3. If neither path is known, locate the script with `search_files(target="files", pattern="meta-ads.sh")` before running it.

This skill's scripts require `social-cli`; JSON parsing paths also require `jq`. Reporting is read-only. Mutating `social marketing pause/resume/set-budget` commands require explicit user approval.

## Brand Memory Integration

**Reads:** `stack.md`, `creative-kit.md`, `audience.md`, `learnings.md` (all optional)

| File | What it provides | How it shapes output |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|
| `workspace/brand/stack.md` | Stored ad account ID, target CPA/ROAS | Auto-fills account, benchmarks performance against targets |
| `workspace/brand/creative-kit.md` | Brand creative guidelines, assets | Context for creative recommendations |
| `workspace/brand/audience.md` | Target audience profiles | Interprets audience performance data |
| `workspace/brand/learnings.md` | Past performance patterns | Spots recurring issues — "this happened last month too" |

### Writes

| File | What it contains |
|------|-----------------|
| `workspace/brand/stack.md` | Stores ad account ID on first use |
| `workspace/brand/learnings.md` | Appends performance findings, fatigue patterns, winning creative traits |

---

## Setup (One Time)

### 1. Install social-cli

```bash
npm install -g @vishalgojha/social-cli
```

### 2. Create a Meta App (if you don't have one)

1. Go to [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com) → My Apps → Create App
2. Choose "Business" type
3. Add "Marketing API" product
4. Note your App ID and App Secret

### 3. Authenticate

```bash
social auth login
# Opens browser → approve → done
```

Or with app credentials:
```bash
social auth set-app --app-id YOUR_APP_ID --app-secret YOUR_APP_SECRET
social auth login --scopes ads_read,ads_management,read_insights
```

### 4. Set default ad account

```bash
social marketing accounts          # Lists your ad accounts
social marketing set-default-account act_123456
```

Or set env: `export META_AD_ACCOUNT=act_123456`

## Reports

### The 5 Daily Questions ← Start Here

The core of the system. Five questions that replace 20 minutes of Ads Manager clicking:

1. **Am I on track?** — Today's spend vs expectations
2. **What's running?** — Active campaigns at a glance
3. **How's performance?** — 7-day metrics by campaign
4. **Who's winning/losing?** — Ad-level performance sorted
5. **Any fatigue?** — CTR trends, frequency, CPC movement

```
Tell me: "Daily ads check"
Or: "Run the 5 questions on my ads"
Or: "How are my Meta ads doing?"
```

Script: `scripts/meta-ads.sh daily-check`

### Overview

Account-level summary with campaign breakdown.

```
Tell me: "Meta ads overview for last 30 days"
```

Script: `scripts/meta-ads.sh overview --preset last_30d`

### Campaigns

List campaigns, optionally filtered by status.

```
Tell me: "Show me active campaigns"
```

Script: `scripts/meta-ads.sh campaigns --status ACTIVE`

### Top Creatives

Ad-level performance ranked by results.

```
Tell me: "What are my best performing ads?"
```

Script: `scripts/meta-ads.sh top-creatives --preset last_7d`

### Bleeders 🩸

Ads with high spend but poor performance — candidates for pause. Flags ads with CTR < 1% or frequency > 3.5.

```
Tell me: "Any ads bleeding money?"
Or: "Find underperforming ads"
```

Script: `scripts/meta-ads.sh bleeders --preset last_7d`

### Winners 🏆

Top performing ads by CTR and efficiency. These are your scale candidates.

```
Tell me: "Which ads should I scale?"
Or: "Show me the winners"
```

Script: `scripts/meta-ads.sh winners --preset last_7d`

### Fatigue Check 😴

Daily breakdown to spot creative fatigue — CTR declining day-over-day, frequency climbing, CPC rising.

```
Tell me: "Any creative fatigue?"
Or: "Check for ad fatigue"
```

Script: `scripts/meta-ads.sh fatigue-check`

### Custom

Full control. Specify level, fields, breakdowns.

```
Tell me: "Show me ad performance broken down by age and gender"
```

Script: `scripts/meta-ads.sh custom --level ad --fields "ad_name,spend,ctr,cpc" --breakdowns "age,gender"`

---

## Date Presets

- `today` — Today only
- `yesterday` — Yesterday only
- `last_7d` — Last 7 days (default for most reports)
- `last_30d` — Last 30 days
- `last_90d` — Last 90 days

---

## Actions (Use With Care)

Beyond reporting, social-cli can take action. These are wrapped here for the "AI ad manager" workflow but require explicit approval.

### Pause a bleeder
```bash
social marketing pause ad AD_ID
```

### Resume a winner
```bash
social marketing resume ad AD_ID
```

### Shift budget
```bash
social marketing set-budget adset ADSET_ID --daily-budget 5000  # in cents
```

**Safety:** All mutating actions are high-risk in social-cli and require confirmation. The skill should ALWAYS present findings and recommendations first, then ask for explicit approval before taking action.

## The AI Ad Manager Workflow

This is the system from the newsletter. Here's how it works in practice:

**Morning (automated via cron):**
1. Run daily-check
2. Flag bleeders (CTR < 1%, frequency > 3.5, CPA > threshold)
3. Flag winners (top CTR, low CPC, scaling headroom)
4. Send summary to Telegram/Slack

**You (2 minutes over coffee):**
1. Read the summary
2. Approve/reject recommendations
3. Ask follow-up questions if needed

**The AI (on approval):**
1. Pause confirmed bleeders
2. Increase budget on confirmed winners
3. Log decisions to learnings.md

---

## Invocation

When the user asks about Meta ads, Facebook ads, Instagram ads, or campaign performance:

1. Check `workspace/brand/stack.md` for stored ad account ID
2. Check `META_AD_ACCOUNT` env var
3. If neither, run `social marketing accounts` to list available accounts
4. Run the appropriate report
5. Interpret results in context of brand goals (from stack.md/learnings.md)
6. For bleeders/winners, present clear recommendations with reasoning
7. **Never take action without explicit user approval**
8. Log findings to `workspace/brand/learnings.md`

### The 5 Daily Questions (Detailed)

When running daily-check, frame the output around these questions:

1. **"Am I on track?"** — Compare today's spend rate to daily budget. If pacing high or low, flag it.
2. **"What's running?"** — List active campaigns with status. Flag any that should be off.
3. **"How's the last 7 days?"** — Campaign-level metrics. Compare to previous 7 if available.
4. **"Who's winning and who's losing?"** — Ad-level sort. Top 3 winners, bottom 3 losers with specific metrics.
5. **"Any fatigue signals?"** — Frequency trends, CTR day-over-day, CPC movement. Concrete numbers, not vibes.
