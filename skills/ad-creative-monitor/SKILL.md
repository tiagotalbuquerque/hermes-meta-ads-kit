# Ad Creative Monitor — Catch Fatigue Early

Creative fatigue is the silent killer of ad accounts. CTR drops 0.1% per day, frequency ticks up, CPC quietly inflates — and by the time you notice in Ads Manager, you've burned through budget.

This skill watches for those signals daily and flags creatives that need rotation.

## How It Works

### Fatigue Signals (ranked by severity)

| Signal | Threshold | Severity |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| CTR dropping 3+ days in a row | >20% decline from peak | 🔴 Critical |
| Frequency above 3.5 | Audience seeing ad too often | 🟡 Warning |
| CPC rising 3+ days in a row | >15% increase from baseline | 🟡 Warning |
| Impressions declining | Ad losing delivery | 🟠 Monitor |

### The Check

```bash
# Run fatigue check (mock/read-only via local adapter)
./run.sh fatigue
```

---

## Reports

### Fatigue Check
Daily scan of all active ads for fatigue signals.

```
Tell me: "Check for creative fatigue"
Or: "Are any ads getting stale?"
```

### Creative Leaderboard
Rank all active creatives by efficiency (CTR × spend volume).

```
Tell me: "Rank my creatives"
Or: "Which creatives are strongest?"
```

### Rotation Recommendations
Based on fatigue signals, recommend which creatives to pause and when new ones are needed.

```
Tell me: "What needs to be rotated?"
Or: "Which ads need fresh creative?"
```

## Invocation

1. Pull ad-level insights with daily time increment via `./scripts/meta-kit.sh`
2. Calculate day-over-day CTR, CPC, and frequency trends
3. Flag any ad showing fatigue signals
4. Compare against benchmarks in `ad-config.json`
5. Present findings with clear severity ratings
6. Recommend rotation schedule if fatigue detected
7. Log findings to `workspace/brand/learnings.md`
