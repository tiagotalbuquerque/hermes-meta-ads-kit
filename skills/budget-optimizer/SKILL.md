# Budget Optimizer — Put Money Where It Works

Most ad accounts have the same problem: budget spread evenly across campaigns when performance isn't even close to even. This skill finds where your money works hardest and recommends shifts.

---

## Reports

### Efficiency Analysis
Rank campaigns/adsets by cost efficiency (CPA, ROAS, or CPC depending on objectives).

```
Tell me: "Where's my money working best?"
Or: "Analyze spend efficiency"
```

### Budget Shift Recommendations
Compare performance across campaigns, recommend moving budget from losers to winners.

```
Tell me: "How should I shift my budget?"
Or: "Optimize my ad spend"
```

### Spend Pacing
Check if campaigns are on pace for their daily/lifetime budgets.

```
Tell me: "Am I overspending or underspending?"
Or: "Check spend pacing"
```

---

## Scripts

```bash
# Efficiency ranking
./run.sh efficiency [--account act_123] [--preset last_7d]

# Spend pacing check
./run.sh pacing [--account act_123]
```

---

## Invocation

1. Pull campaign and adset level insights
2. Calculate efficiency metrics (CPA, ROAS, CPC relative to spend)
3. Compare against benchmarks in `ad-config.json`
4. Identify top and bottom performers
5. Calculate recommended budget shifts (% based)
6. Present recommendations with clear reasoning
7. **Never adjust budget without explicit approval**
8. Log decisions to `workspace/brand/learnings.md`

---

## Safety

Budget changes are **high-risk actions**. This skill:
- Always shows current vs. recommended budget
- Explains the reasoning (data-backed)
- Waits for explicit "yes" before executing
- Logs every budget change for audit trail
