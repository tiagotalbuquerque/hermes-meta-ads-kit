# Meta Ads Copilot — Full Spec

**Created:** Feb 23, 2026
**Updated:** Apr 30, 2026
**Status:** local official-CLI adapter in progress
**Owner:** @themattberman

## Overview

An OpenClaw-powered Meta Ads manager that replaces daily Ads Manager sessions with AI-generated briefings and recommendations.

**The Promise:**
Configure official Meta Ads CLI access → run daily briefings with bleeders, winners, pacing, and fatigue alerts → review dry-run recommendations → approve any spend-impacting action explicitly.

**Target Users:**
- Founders running their own Meta ads
- Small marketing teams without a dedicated media buyer
- Agency operators managing multiple accounts
- Anyone tired of clicking through Ads Manager

## System Architecture

   ↓
run.sh
   ↓
scripts/meta-kit.sh              # local dispatcher/report layer
   ↓
scripts/lib/config.sh            # env loading and account selection
scripts/lib/meta-cli.sh          # official CLI wrapper + snapshots
scripts/lib/safety.sh            # approval, dry-run, PAUSED-only guards
scripts/lib/mock.sh              # fixture-backed mock mode
   ↓
Official Meta Ads CLI (`meta`, package `meta-ads`)
   ↓
Meta Marketing API
```

The adapter layer keeps OpenClaw skills stable while Meta's CLI syntax stays centralized in one mapping file.

## Official Meta Ads CLI baseline

Official docs path:
`https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/ads-ai-connectors/ads-cli/ads-cli-overview`

Key facts:
- Package: `meta-ads` on PyPI
- Binary: `meta`
- Python: 3.12+
- Auth: Meta admin system user access token
- Official env vars: `ACCESS_TOKEN`, `AD_ACCOUNT_ID`, optional `BUSINESS_ID`
- Command pattern: `meta ads <resource> <action> [options]`
- Global flags go before `ads`, e.g. `meta --output json --no-input ads campaign list`
- Resource names are singular: `campaign`, `adset`, `ad`, `creative`, `adaccount`, `page`, `insights`, `dataset`, `catalog`, `product-feed`, `product-item`, `product-set`

---

## Skills

### Skill 1: `meta-ads`
**Purpose:** Daily reporting and ad-management recommendations.

Reports:
- Daily check / 5 Daily Questions
- Account overview
- Campaign listing
- Winners
- Bleeders
- Fatigue check
- Efficiency and pacing reads

### Skill 2: `ad-creative-monitor`
**Purpose:** Track creative health over time.

Capabilities:
- CTR trend monitoring
- Frequency creep detection
- CPC inflation alerts
- Creative rotation recommendations

### Skill 3: `budget-optimizer`
**Purpose:** Spend efficiency analysis.

Capabilities:
- Campaign efficiency ranking
- Budget shift recommendations
- Spend pacing checks
- Recommendations only unless explicitly approved

### Skill 4: `ad-copy-generator`
**Purpose:** Generate ad copy matched to specific image creatives.

Capabilities:
- Analyze image creative
- Cross-reference winning copy patterns when read-only data is available
- Generate headline/body variants
- Output payload candidates for `ad-upload` dry runs

### Skill 5: `ad-upload`
**Purpose:** Prepare upload/create payloads for Meta.

Capabilities:
- Build creative/ad payload candidates
- Validate payload posture
- Use official CLI-first where supported
- Create only as `PAUSED`, only after explicit approval

### Skill 6: `pixel-capi`
**Purpose:** Audit Meta Pixel + Conversions API setup.

Capabilities:
- Dataset/pixel inventory via official CLI where supported
- CAPI testing remains separate and approval-gated because it can send events to Meta

## Data Flow

### Morning Briefing
1. Cron or user triggers `./run.sh daily-check`.
2. `run.sh` calls `scripts/meta-kit.sh`.
3. Adapter loads config and mode.
4. In `mock` mode, fixtures are used.
5. In `read-only` mode, the adapter calls official Ads CLI and saves snapshots.
6. Reports identify pacing, active campaigns, trends, winners, bleeders, and fatigue.
7. Agent presents recommendations and asks before any action.

### On-Demand
1. User asks a question.
2. Agent selects the matching report command.
3. Adapter pulls mock/read-only data.
4. Agent interprets against `ad-config.json` and brand memory.
5. If spend-impacting action is useful, agent creates a dry-run plan and waits for approval.

## Modes

| Mode | Purpose | External calls | Mutations |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| `mock` | Local development/demo | No | No |
| `read-only` | Real reporting | Yes, read-only | No |
| `live-approved` | Explicitly approved mutation session | Yes | Approval-gated |

---

## Safety Model

### Read-only by default
Reporting can run in `mock` or `read-only`. Live mutations are never implicit.

### Approval required
Any action that affects spend requires explicit user confirmation:
- create/update/delete resources
- pause/resume/status changes
- budget changes
- any command using `--force`

### Dry-run artifacts
Every proposed mutation writes a JSON artifact under `local/dry-runs/` containing:
- timestamp
- account ID
- mode
- exact command preview
- payload path
- risk note
- approval requirement
- rollback note

### PAUSED-only creation
New campaigns/ad sets/ads/creatives must be created as `PAUSED` unless a later reviewed version intentionally changes this. Deletes remain unsupported in v1.

### Secrets
Ignored by git:
- `.env`
- `.env.*.local`
- `local/`
- `*.token`
- `*.secrets`

## Benchmarks & Thresholds

Default thresholds in `ad-config.json`:

| Metric | Default | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Bleeder CTR | < 1.0% | Flag underperforming ads |
| Max frequency | > 3.5 | Creative fatigue signal |
| Fatigue CTR drop | > 20% over 3 days | Early fatigue warning |
| Spend pace alert | ±15% of daily budget | Over/underspend warning |
| Target CPA | $25.00 | Campaign efficiency target |
| Target ROAS | 3.0x | Return on ad spend target |

---

## Verification

Local/static:

```bash
bash -n run.sh scripts/*.sh scripts/lib/*.sh
```

Mock reports:

```bash
META_KIT_MODE=mock ./run.sh daily-check
META_KIT_MODE=mock ./run.sh overview --preset last_7d
META_KIT_MODE=mock ./run.sh campaigns
META_KIT_MODE=mock ./run.sh bleeders
META_KIT_MODE=mock ./run.sh winners
META_KIT_MODE=mock ./run.sh fatigue
META_KIT_MODE=mock ./run.sh efficiency
META_KIT_MODE=mock ./run.sh pacing
META_KIT_MODE=mock ./scripts/meta-kit.sh doctor
```

Official CLI help, no credentials required:

```bash
uvx --python 3.12 --from meta-ads meta --help
uvx --python 3.12 --from meta-ads meta ads --help
uvx --python 3.12 --from meta-ads meta ads campaign list --help
uvx --python 3.12 --from meta-ads meta ads insights get --help
```
